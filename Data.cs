                ""answer"": ""Overall – I think Nathan Schlenhlein would be a strong contributor on a Studio team. I would not call him expert, but the fundamentals are quite solid and the human factors are strong. A growth opportunity for him is to gather more information before starting.\n \nRecommendation – continue with process.\n------------------------\n \nPast times I ran Gilded Rose, I (mistakenly, according to the interview Document) allowed candidates to read the basic rules. This time I did not, feeding individual rules once he’d run into them. \n \nWith Nathan being a candidate for Studios, I didn’t ask him to explain each step like a coach might.\n \nHe asked me how to start and I asked back what he would do if this was at his job. He chose to protect existing code with some tests, then refactor to get some clarity, then implement the feature. (A choice I liked)\nHe found the main file which printed item states for several items before and after an updateQuality and used its results to make a gold test. He struggled a bit to get python arrays to compare, getting an error that said something like “\u003cthing\u003e != \u003cthing\u003e”. Handled himself well when facing trouble, worked himself out of it.\n \n \nIt was late in the session when I noticed we were still refactoring and hadn’t implemented the feature. I mentioned it and he wrote a test for the new feature and implemented it.\nInitial struggles interfered with getting into the R-G-R loop for a while, and only writing a couple lines of implementation he didn’t have a chance to show refactoring his code or his test. \n \nHe didn’t commit progress; I didn’t find the right time to mention it. I’m confident that he’d get (back?) into that groove if partner reminded him.\n \nHis refactor was heading toward separate code for each type of item. I asked how we might improve it if every item had its own code. He said something about a switch. I asked what else. After a moment, I asked if there was an OO way to make it better. Once I asked that, had all sorts of good ideas about what that might look like.\n \nHe mistakenly started to refactor on red one time.\n \nAsked how he thought it went, he offered that he started to panic a little bit when there were struggles. He appeared stressed, but I did not see panic. He offered that he wished he had asked more questions about the business rules at the start, saying that doing so would have saved some time.\n \nParting thought from him was a thank-you to me for “calling him out” on a remark he made at Pillar. I don’t remember the specifics, but he said it got him thinking about inclusion and in a future job he felt he was better prepared to address a situation where a woman hadn’t been able to fully be her best self because inclusion hadn’t been a focus. This is a characteristic I like in team members.\n \nWas very good with his IDE. Got his first red test quickly. Struggled some with python syntax. (Not sure why he didn’t pick his “day job” language. We saw this problem with another candidate, didn’t we?)\n \nI wish I had asked: “Oh, Python. Is that what you’re best at?” Maybe we start adding that.\n\nNote from Rich: \nGood feedback. I don’t know why he wouldn’t pick JavaScript (his $day_job language). And your right, we’ve seen that elsewhere. I don’t know what it means, but maybe we should suggest people ‘put their best foot forward’ on this. I had a candidate use Rust, a language he barley knew. Maybe we aren’t getting the point across?\n\n\n.rich\n ""
